Spacecraft's physics simulation in weightlessness for my Bachelor thesis. 6 DOF, interactive controls. Done with Unity, OculusVR and some free assets. 
Uploading only scripts because of too large files. 
The most interesting thing is Filter class. Making use of it I could cut off high frequencies from player input which let me interpolate gently between real-time velocity changes.
Unity 2018.1.2f1
